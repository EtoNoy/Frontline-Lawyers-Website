                Criminal law is highly complex and depends heavily on the specific facts and circumstances of each individual case. Minor variations in police procedures, evidence, or personal backgrounds can completely alter the appropriate legal strategy.

We strongly advise that you seek professional, personalized legal counsel regarding your specific situation before making any decisions.
